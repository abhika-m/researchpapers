|Research Paper|Short Description|
|-|-|
|[NaturalProver](https://github.com/abhika-m/researchpapers/blob/main/NaturalProver.md)|NLP model which improves mathematical proof generation as well next step generation for proofs 
|[CORA](https://github.com/abhika-m/researchpapers/blob/main/CORA.md)|Improving QA models to utilize documents from multiple languages when generating answers in order to increase inclusivety and make otherwise unanswerable questions due to lack of data answerable
|[Commonsense Generation](https://github.com/abhika-m/researchpapers/blob/main/CommonSenseReasoning.md)| Using generated knowledge statements to improve accuracy of QA models
|[Delphi Experiment](https://github.com/abhika-m/researchpapers/blob/main/DelphiExperiment.md)|NLP model which determines whether a statement or question is ethical or not, [try demo here](https://delphi.allenai.org/)
|[Red Teaming](https://github.com/abhika-m/researchpapers/blob/main/RedTeaming.md)|Incorporating red teaming efforts (purposefully producing harmful results to update models to prevent that from happening again) to reduce harmful and offensive responses by AI assistants
